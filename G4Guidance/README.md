<h3>G4 Guidance</h3>
<p>A lot of students in Pakistan face difficulty in choosing a good University according to their academic records, most of the time they don’t even know which university they should apply for. G4 Guidance is a student guidance and counseling website that will help students of Pakistan to choose Universities wisely according to their academic records after Intermediate or O Levels. This website will ask for Matric, Intermediate and Entrance test marks of student and then calculate his aggregate according to each university after that it’ll compare the merit with previous year merit of each university, most probably previous year merit will be less than the current year merit so if student has aggregate more than previous year merit then there's a probability that he can get admission current year, also there’ll be blogs and videos for student’s career counseling. This is how G4 Guidance will guide students of Pakistan to choose best University for their better future.</p>
